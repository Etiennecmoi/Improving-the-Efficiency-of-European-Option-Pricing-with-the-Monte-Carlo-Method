# Improving-the-Efficiency-of-European-Option-Pricing-with-the-Monte-Carlo-Method
This subject focuses on variance reduction in the context of Monte Carlo option pricing under the Black-Scholes model.
This subject explores how to use Monte Carlo methods to price options, how the number of simulations affects the accuracy of the price estimate, and how variance reduction techniques can improve the efficiency of these methods, particularly for options that are difficult to price accurately with standard Monte Carlo.
